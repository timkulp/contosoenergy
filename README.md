I will provide a more complete ReadMe shortly. For now I have just dumped everything into a single directory. Originally the plan was to have 2 directories, one complete solution and one framework. After working with some team members on the framework vs. complete solution, we thought the framework was complete solution enough. And that if you want to start from scratch, the Article provides enough context to start from scratch and then this code is used to provide the completeness referenced in the article.
